// Adam wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the SMIâ€¯bank every day. He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday. Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the SMI bank at the end of the nth day.
