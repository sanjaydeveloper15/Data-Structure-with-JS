In this repository we cover some of the most commonly asked JavaScript data structure questions related to arrays, strings and objects which commonly asked in interviews at tier 1 companies.

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort)
- Search Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)

### Questions Covered Like Below

1. Custom sorting program in JS via Bubble Sort ?
2. Write a program to check if a string or word or number is palindrome ?
3. Write a program to check if value/target exists or not in ascending array in O(log n) time complexity ?
4. Write a program to get total vowel count from String ?
5. Write a program to prints factorial of any number ?
6. Write a program for check number is prime or not ?
7. Write a program to check whether number is perfect number or not ?
8. Write a program to find duplicate numbers in an integer array ?
9. How do you remove duplicates from an integer array ?
10. We have group of people in the form of array and you have to group people basis upon age ?
11. Count unique value from Sorted Array without using any array methods and set() with **O(n)** Time Complexity ?
and lot more...

### Fequency Counter

Many times you need to compare between 2 arrays in that situation simplest solution is use Nested loops or Linear Searching, which eventually has an Big O n(Square) O(n^2) Time Complexity, For solving this problem we can use Frequency Counter, In which we found first Frequency of both arrays then simple run loop of any 1 Frequency object/array and compare it directly.


### Multiple Pointers

Many times in **Sorted Array** we need to compare and we generally do nested loop so for solving this we can use this Multiple Pointer magic, in which we generally use **Binary Search Algorithm**. We 1st have to analyse our pointer it could be 1st or Last indexs or 1st or 2nd *Indexes*.
